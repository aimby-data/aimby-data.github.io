    <h1>West Sawtelle Town Hall — Questions for Councilmember Traci Park</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>CD11 Neighborhood Listening Session — January 15, 2026</strong><br />
      Introduction: Lee Ziff &nbsp;|&nbsp; Q&amp;A: Carla Lona
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Councilmember Park, thank you for being here and for taking the time to meet with our neighborhood.
      </p>

      <p>
        We recognize that CD11 is an incredibly large and complex district, spanning communities with very different needs —
        from Palisades fire recovery, to Venice public safety and homelessness, to Sawtelle’s transit-oriented growth pressures,
        to major commercial corridors.
      </p>

      <p>
        We appreciate that you have to balance many competing priorities across the district, and we’re grateful that you’re here
        tonight to listen to ours. Our neighborhood is changing rapidly, and we’re looking forward to sharing our concerns and
        hearing how your office can help address them in the context of the broader district you represent.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>SB 79 &amp; Densification</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Local Protection, Alternative Planning &amp; Fairness</h3>

      <p>
        Sawtelle already supports one of the highest residential density loads in CD11 and the city as a whole.
        How will you ensure SB 79 does not further concentrate growth here while wealthier transit- and opportunity-zone
        neighborhoods avoid their share?
      </p>

      <p>
        Specifically, using publicly available parcel and unit data, residents calculated that the Expo/Bundy half-mile radius
        already supports approximately 14,836 housing units today, even before any zoning changes. Under SB 79’s upzoning
        framework, that same area would support roughly 17,262 units.
      </p>

      <p>
        Given that level of existing density — including major projects like Carmel Partners and West Edge — would you support
        delayed effectuation or an alternative SB 79 implementation approach for Expo/Bundy based on current density and
        infrastructure load?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>City Transit Hub Rule, Low-Medium Density &amp; Finalizing a Pre–SB 79 Community Plan</h3>

      <p>
        Under the revised Westside Community Plan released in October 2025 — before SB 79 — nearly all remaining low-medium
        density parcels in Sawtelle (R1.5 and R2) are slated for upzoning to medium density (R3), not because of SB 79, but
        because of the City’s own transit-hub rule.
      </p>

      <p>
        Planning staff have told residents their “hands are tied” and that community input cannot be reflected, even though
        these parcels are already in a very dense neighborhood and densifying organically through duplexes and ADUs.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, SB 79 has now fundamentally changed the land-use map across the city. In that context, it feels
        arbitrary and irresponsible to finalize a community plan that was written for a pre–SB 79 world and permanently
        eliminates low-medium zoning in already dense neighborhoods like West Sawtelle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Will your office push back on finalizing this plan as written, and advocate for sensible exceptions to the transit-hub
        rule so that low-medium zoning — which supports duplexes, ADUs, and attainable homeownership — is not eliminated entirely?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Housing, Homeownership &amp; Long-Term Community Stability</h3>

      <p>
        We’ve seen large corporations purchase and demolish dozens of single-family homes to build large rental projects like
        Carmel Partners, West Edge, and the Expo Project. At the same time, most new housing is small rental units for
        short-term residents, while LAUSD enrollment keeps declining.
      </p>

      <p>
        With nearly all new housing being rentals, how is the City preventing the creation of a permanent renter class and
        preserving homeownership opportunities? And how is the City thinking about whether CD11 can support families and
        long-term residents — not just young professionals cycling through one-bedroom apartments?
      </p>

      <p>
        For a healthy city, we need a mix of renters and owners, young professionals, families, and long-term residents.
        Is this something the City should be actively planning for?
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Neighborhood Livability &amp; Long-Term Stability</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Commercial Corridor Revitalization</h3>

      <p>
        What strategies is the City using to revitalize struggling corridors like Santa Monica Blvd between the 405 and Bundy
        and Pico, where boarded-up retail, encampments, and neglected streets have persisted for years?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Safety, Crime, Homelessness, Public Space &amp; Street Lighting</h3>

      <p>
        Break-ins, slow police response, poor street lighting, and sidewalk encampments all affect whether residents feel safe
        walking in their own neighborhood.
      </p>

      <p>
        What is your overall strategy for improving public safety and keeping streets and sidewalks usable — including crime
        prevention, police response, street lighting, and humane but effective triage for people experiencing homelessness and
        mental-health crises?
      </p>

      <p>
        Specifically, what is the process for adding street lighting and addressing persistent encampments so that residents
        can safely walk, bike, and use public space?
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Infrastructure &amp; DWP RS-K Plant</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>DWP Communication &amp; Project Oversight</h3>

      <p>
        Neighbors are concerned about the RS-K plant project — the new wall, aesthetics, noise, EMF exposure, and the breakdown
        in communication from DWP.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our neighborhood would like your help pushing for better mitigation, vegetation screening on the new wall, and greater
        transparency going forward. Is this something your office is willing to help us with?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Infrastructure &amp; Services Capacity</h3>

      <p>
        If the City continues densifying this area, what commitments exist to upgrade infrastructure — roads, sewers, schools,
        green space, and emergency services — so that density does not degrade quality of life?
      </p>

      <p>
        What are you committed to doing to help our neighborhood?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Traffic Calming &amp; Speeding</h3>

      <p>
        Car speeds along Nebraska have been increasing. Will CD11 help us reduce speeds along Nebraska, potentially placing
        bump-outs and a stop sign at Amherst, similar to the stop sign installed at Iowa and Wellesley?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Environmental Health &amp; Pollution</h3>

      <p>
        During peak summer months, Los Angeles experienced a high number of unhealthy air quality days, and urban runoff
        continues to impact coastal water quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        What actions did City Council take in 2025 to address air and water pollution, particularly in Westside communities?
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>CD11 Governance &amp; Priorities</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Neighborhood Council Accountability</h3>

      <p>
        Please explain your relationship with the Neighborhood Councils. When a Neighborhood Council passes a motion and sends
        it to your office, do you see it? What is the process for review, discussion, and action at City Council?
      </p>

      <p><small>Community voice: John Levine</small></p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>City Operations &amp; AI Efficiency</h3>

      <p>
        What is the City doing to explore AI solutions for interfacing with taxpayers, automating outdated systems, and
        improving response times? Hiring more staff to answer phones is expensive, and modern tools can already handle some
        of that load. What is the City doing to incorporate AI?
      </p>

      <p><small>Community voice: Tom Meyers</small></p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Coyotes &amp; Public Safety</h3>

      <p>
        There are ongoing concerns about increasingly large packs of coyotes appearing nightly in our neighborhood. We hear
        them howling regularly and worry about the safety of our children and pets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Does the City know why more coyotes are migrating here, and what is being done to address this? Who should residents
        contact to report and track this issue?
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Community Resource: Planning, Zoning &amp; Housing Enforcement</h2>

    <p>
      Many residents have asked how RHNA, the Housing Element, SB 79, and the City’s Community Planning process fit together —
      and where real zoning and land-use authority actually lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fact sheet below explains how planning enforcement works in practice, what is truly state-mandated versus
      City-controlled, and where community input can still shape outcomes.
